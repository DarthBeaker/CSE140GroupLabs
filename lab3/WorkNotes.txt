Can assume the instruction is valid; 

Will need to convert between hex and binary.

The instructions are fairly succinct.

Have 2 weeks to do it; we will need to demo at least 1 instruction for each type. R, I, S, & SB.

Divide the work: comment on which part you did.

When you submit the work, make sure that the code compiles and runs (no segfaults either) even if there is a low grade.


Tasks:

Prompt user for input  ***These should go in print(), currently in main

read user input

store input as a char array? 	C-String array.

parse the char array (can assume it is a valid instruction).
	- divide into the different fields
	- #1 Op-Code
	- #2 Funct3
	- #3 Funct7
	- #4 Rd
	- #5 Rs1, Rs1
	- # Immediates

Function to convert binary to hex

Need functions that output the:  	(note is not applicable for all, depends on the type of instruction)
	a) correct instuction type
	b) Operation
	c) Source Registers Rs1, Rs2
	d) Destination Registers Rd
	e) Funct3 
	f) Funct7
	g) Immediate (in hex and decimal)

	Jesse taking I & SB-instructions
	Kieran taking R & S

	Going to put the def in a .h file, along with the function headers

	.h file for the def later

	convert the binary 1st, then can print easily as decimal and hex will research

	R: 	00000000001100100000001010110011
	I: 	00000000101001100111011010010011
	S: 	11111110001100100000100000100011
	SB:	00000001111000101001001101100011
	UJ: 00000000101000000000000011101111
	U: both have different OPcodes... added on 2/22/24

	2/16/24 parse_instruction is working; returns a single char that will need to 
	be interpreted by the print function. JLP

	2/22/24 starting broad strokes for the parse_immediate:
	will need to know the instruction, then can parse Immediate
	correctly (for the particular instruction)
